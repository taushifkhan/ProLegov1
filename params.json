Get fasta file of filtered PDB chains from rcsb with required structure\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n2. Run Cd-Hit to cluster them with sequence identity cut-off with following\r\ncode: see readme_folder/cdhitOutfile\r\n\r\n3.

Get pdb chains of required number of alpha helix content. min 3 max 10..\r\n    Can be done by awk: \r\n    awk '{if ($6 >=3 && $6 <=10) print $0}' sse_number_13_4_14 | wc -l\r\n    $1047 \r\n    awk '{if ($6 >=3 && $6 <=10) print $1$2}' sse_number_13_4_14 \r\n    > pdb_chain_3_10_14APR_14\r\n\r\n\r\n5.

Objective: helix contact patterns in protein domains from astral 1.75.
Astral is the curated domain set with available 40 and 90 sequence 
identity cut-off. In this folder alpha proteins from 40% sequence identity
cut-off has been considered.

Steps are similar to previously described HPP of alpha helice in example_set1 folder 
with following modification:
    
    1. modify all_helix.c code to take up domain names as they are different
    from pdbid and chain. domain : d+ <4 letter pdid>+<chain>+<2letter domain info>
    domain info : a[1-9] or a_
    2. as there is some problem in naming run pre_process.py with helix_shape.txt
    and helix_packing_pair_15.txt
    3. rename processed_helix_shpae.txt to helSpaceTab ()
    4. run bash script to get pattern file
